# Modular Image Diffeomorphisms
Generate perfectly invertible image distortion maps from modular mix-and-match distortion "seeds". Extend your own! Endless fun! Learn what the great science word "diffeomorphism" is!

# About 
This application was used to generate training and testing data for deep neural networks in [a scientific paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11263-018-1082-6). To visualize the generated optical-flow fields, check out [this repo](https://github.com/nikolausmayer/optical-flow-visualization)!

# Usage
Put [CImg.h](http://cimg.eu/) into `src`, then `make`. This will run a full example on the included `grid.ppm` image.
